#summary An introduction how to enable pyang complex type extension

= How to use =

The implementation of the complex type extension to pyang is a python module available at $PYANG-CT_ROOT/pyang/plugins/complex-types.py. The test cases for the extension can be found in $PYANG-CT_ROOT/test/test_linowski_ext.

By default the pyang complex type extension is disabled. In order to enable it the '--enable-complex-types' argument should be passed as a command line argument to pyang.
